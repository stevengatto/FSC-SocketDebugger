## Digital Ocean Setup
[This article by Daniel Speichert](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-meteor-js-application-on-ubuntu-14-04-with-nginx)
is a good explanation of how to get this application up and running on a Digital Ocean Ubuntu 14.04 droplet. 
Use the [GitHub student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to get $100 in Digital Ocean credit, a free SSL cert from NameCheap, and much more.
